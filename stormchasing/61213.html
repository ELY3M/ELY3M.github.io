I did my own forecasting about couple days before this chase.  
I thought that there will be tornadoes in exact areas in Iowa.  
This is the time that my forecasting is accurate and sucessful.    
<p>
I saw PDS tornado watch in Iowa after work and made decision to 
go south to Iowa.  I made decision to go to waterloo area and east.  
I did caught up to the big HP cell in Decorah.  
as I drive in very heavy rain and I see that winds got very bad and I decided to stop.  
I looked to side window and saw vortex moving away into field.

<p>
like 10 mins later, I refreshed my radar and saw that there is reported tornado on this cell!    
It is 2rd unwarned tornado in my life that I actually drove by.     
NWS never ever warned this cell.

Nice tornado outbreak in Iowa.
