Around midnight in Rochester, MN I saw some nice hail icons on my radar and I right went outside. 
I saw small hails coming down and tried to measure it and take pics :)    

<p>

I went to work later this morning and watched the weather outside of the dock.  
It was sunny day....  after work, I see that there is tornado watch on west of MN and I filled up my truck and just bolted to west.

<p> 

I see cells moving to east slowly and I chase them.  I see raining and wind.  
I sometimes see some rotations.  I saw very strong rotation in St. Peter and I saw dark cloud lowering in that town.  
then I decided to make left turn to attempt to see more of the clouds in the town.  I ended up in an taxis parking lot and in a core of hail! 
I went out with my helmet on and collected and measured hail stones. they turned to be golf balls and one inch.     
I had to get back in my truck as It rains very hard and wind was very bad.  I watch hail stones melting very fast.

I decided to call off chase and start go east to go back home.  

<p>

<p>
I decided to stop to take more lightning pictures and videos.   
<p>
later, I tried to leave. I cant get out of grass part.  
police did came to me and tried to help me.  
I did saw alot of beautiful lightning till daylight.   
when daylight came up, I made a decision to call my friends at CSC Towing in Rochester, MN.  
They decided to send a truck over here.

This area have been getting a lot of rain from MCS systems. 
I learned from this mistake is not park over on grass.  I rather park on solid shoulders now.  
usually, not alot of traffic after 12/1 am 
Also, buy a towing strap for future. I would have to make sure it will support +5000 lbs vehicle. 
I know I am not alone who got stuck in muddy grass!  many other storm chasers did get stuck in mud often.  
Both Sean Casey and Reed Timmer did got stuck in mud after their tornado intercepts.   
I watched TIV getting towed by some big truck in KS on youtube.

later today, I saw some nice cell exploding east of Rochester, MN and I went outside and saw nice cells growing and spreading.  
Here are few videos, I did saw a rotating funnel cloud on this cell. It could have tornadoed front of me and NWS could have not warned it quicky. 
I did saw some weak rotations in this cell on radar.
