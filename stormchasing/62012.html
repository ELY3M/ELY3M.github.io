I was in hospital for few days before and I just got out of hospital on that day.  
I went home for awhile then I decided to go to hy-vee north to get some food......    
I have been watching radar on my phone and knowing that Rochester will have interesting storm that day.    
I grabbed food quickly because clouds is changing rapidly and I wanted to go driving for awhile after I am done with shopping at hy-vee.   
I go back to my truck and videotape the clouds for awhile and I noticed few funnel-like shapes and some rotation.

alot of interesting stuff going on with clouds as I drive on hwy 63.

<p>
rain go down harder and I started to see some white little balls hitting. 
so I know it was hailing at that time.  It was very small hail.    

<p>

I saw bright pink CG (cloud to ground) lightning.  
It was beauitful. too bad that I do not get it on videotape.   

<p>
I think I drove around 20 miles from hy-vee north to Hunt's drug store to pickup more of my meds.

It was fun chasing that storm on that day!  <br> 
I was amazed to see interesting clouds at Hy-Vee North store.   
I see people just going to their vehicles with their groceries.  
no one noticed anything going on.
