I watched SPC and models for days and know we could have severe thunderstorms outbreaks in the area with possible tornado.  
I decided to chase when my area got tornado watch and I had to go out early to catch some cells.   
<p><img src=51913/Screenshot_2013-05-19-13-50-37.png><p>

I decided to go south on hwy 63 for awhile.  
I did catch some nice shelf cloud and very heavy gust wind and heavy rain.

<p>
After the shelf cloud passed me.

<p>

after those storms passed me. I drove toward hwy 14 to chase east because there are more cells coming toward to that hwy 14. 
few of them got tornado warned.  I wanted to catch a tornado!  

<p>
as I drive... on hwy 14 near some cities. I saw some tornadic cell and watching radar on my phone.  
I am seeing some strong rotations on radar and it should be tor warned!

<p>
I know NWS are usually slow with tornado warning rotations. 
<p>
There was TVS (Tornado Vortex Signature) on my radar!  upside down red triangle on my radar is TVS.   
<p>

I decided to drive foward and I saw so much fog and heavy wind. 
It look like the ground was smoking!  very similar thing happened as tornado was developing.  
I seen this similar smoking from ground in other storm chaser's videos.   
<p> 
<p><img src=51913/KARX_20130519_193208.png><p>
yes this is me right in middle of the tornado warning (red polygon box)  
<br>
you also can see that there is hook echo NE of me.

<p>
as storm passed. I drive down hwy 14 and made right turn to some gravel road down the path of tor warning 
to see if there was any serious damage from this cell.  only I saw is some roofing materials? black debris on road 
and broken off tree.

<p>
I drove back to home... watching beautiful lightning. 
great for photographers who love to take pics of lightning.   
next day, 
Someone told me on youtube that the storms I chased was mentioned on TWC.    
<p>
Few weeks later and after few storm chases....  GUESS WHAT?!?!??      
I saw a picture of funnel in the area very close to lewiston....   
someone took picture of the funnel. I must be under there because of amount of fog I saw.    
<p>

<br>
I went on SPC and looked up storm reports... NO TORNADO REPORT in this area!   
<br> I guess NWS do not bother going over this area and verify if there were tornado was really there.    
<p>  
I won't say that it was a tornado or not...
