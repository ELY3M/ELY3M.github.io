I felt a very strong shock. I thought a lightning had hit very hard.  I heard from a friend that the lightning had blew up few holes in the street next to us. 
We walked over there and saw them. It was very big.  I found alot of fat worms all over sidewalk and street.  
<p>
next day, they found gas leaking some where. It was blocked off for awhile. it was obviously from a gas station.  
<p>
It had gotten better lately, the 11th street reopen to only one lanes of traffic.

Aug 10 2011 UPDATE: I found those old page and images after I read the lightning stuff story in some FB group. <br>
Today is Aug 10 2011 and I drove on same street and I saw those "scars" in the street.  You can still see the "scars" / patches <br>
where they fixed the holes today.  I still remeber the night that my house shook badly and I went outside  and saw the big holes <br>
and worms all over....  crazy and scary night. <br>
