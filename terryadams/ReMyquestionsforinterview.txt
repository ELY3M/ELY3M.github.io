my name is terry adams and i guess the only nick name that i have is imp ,
eugene colins gave it to me i think it means crazy little devil 2. i live in
hammond la 3. i am 15 years old 4. i dont go to school but my mom home
schools me, i work about 1 or 2 hours a day i am going to college in about 4
months , so that is kinda weird at 15 . 5. eugene collins got me in to
riding flatland  when i was about 11 so i guess i got an early start on
things.6. well i think that i look up at andrew arroyo a lot and  nathean p.
but eugene the most.7. my favorite riders are eugene collins, jason brown,
andrew faris, andrew arroyo, nathean p., and marti k. is my real favorite.
8. well i think think that i have rode with every pro except edgar ,  garry
smith , ross smith , chase and that crazy dude from canada named stefen. 9.
well when i ride alone i think that is when i get the job but when i ride
with people that hypes me up alot so that helps me progress alot too so i
think i like both.10.  haha shin gaurds are good i used to ride with them
but now i feel kinda stupid wearing them , like i am from the ply wood hoods
or somthing. 11. well one time i broke my wrist on a box jump in a show a
long time ago it hurt .12. that was the wrost one i think, nope one time i
broke my finger nail off doing a bar flip. 13. i have been tring to ride
about 5 to 7 hours a day.14. hahha i try to ride street all the time with my
friend ben  and i always get a big head and hurt my self , but i reall y
never ride any dirt except the aunt hill in my back yard, hahah 14. well i
love doing 360s and no footers but no footer are my favorite i guess 15. i
used to race in 92 when i was very little then i got me a frestyle bike and
never went back to the track.16. i think they come a little easy to me all
tricks do.17. it was like a pogo on the back pegs i thought i was bad.18.
hitch hikers are cool and hitch hikers are real cool i love them i just
learned to spin them and i love the way it feels i just love hitch hikers
period. 19. i like both front and back but i think there are more things to
do on the front wheel . 20. because i am stoked. 21. well every time i try
to concontrate ojn my style i stary riding like someone else so i been just
riding and hoping my style will form in its own way , it will. 22. nope. 23.
its cool to see people that have a lot of control ride brakless like chad
degrot and chase. but i have nothing against it i see my self pulling mine
of in a few years.24. bike zone-drews bmx mail order [swap meet] - play
clothing- and 2-hip bikes.25. it is cool to have a company to support.26. i
could not really tell you because i dont make money off from it, just co
sponscered.27. i dont think i have a favorite frame but i like the stout boy
that i am on.28. not really except i would like to say that i broke like 13
gt show and i hate that bike but heard the 99, was better.29. it was the
1997 x trails in orlando florida. i loved it.30. well i like to watch myself
pull somthing every now and then so i will get my mom to go out there and
film me.31. oh linkt was the first real video but eugene made one a while
back that i was in called flatland kings. 32.espn is the one thing that is
keeping the sport a live so who cares if paul higgins says the names of the
tricks wrong. and the x games are rad.33. i will not quit riding ever i am
addicted to it , if i am not riding i am thinking of riding but i ride more
than i think beacuse thinking gets me mad because when i am thinking of
riding it is because it is raining or somthing.34.i would like to thank  my
mom for everything she has paid for on my bike and 2-hip bikes for hooking
me up with the co sponscership [ron wilkerson] and hal up at play clothes
for being the nice person that he is and andrew arroyo for being the crazy
dude that he is. and i would love to thank aaron behnke for being a complete
ass to me a play contest in north carolina. i hate you aaron-- 355555.--
keep riding and keep eating those tijuana mama pickled sausages...
