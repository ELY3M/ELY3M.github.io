since I was little kid, my mother got me a nes system and I loved playing Super Mario Bros game.  
I got game genie and made weird cheats and other stuff.  on SMB3 I made a flying frog.   
I also got SNES later then a gamecube and N64.  I started modding my gamecube to run homebrew stuff.  
Thanks to <a href=https://fail0verflow.com/ben>Bushing</a>, fail0verflow, and #wiidev team, 
I put open sourced mod chips and homebrew on my wiis.  I owned about 3 wiis around this time. 
they are packed up in boxes here now. I created few of my own homebrew apps for wiis.   
<p>
I have done nintendo handhelds. I have DS and DSi and I buy homebrew flash cards and loved them.  
I installed CFW on all of my 3ds consoles and used moon jumps on super mario maker hahaha 
<p>
Around Black friday of 2018, I decided to get switch console for cheap.  I got Super Mario Odyssey game for xmas.  
I played SMO for hours and I even took my switch with me at work for playing on my lunches.  
some time later, I saw many youtube videos on modded super mario odyssey levels.  I decided to get another switch 
for homebrew and modding SMO knowing that I would get banned on my first switch.  on ebay, I bidded on one and won one.  
It was banned one because it was son who run <a href=https://github.com/Reisyukaku/ReiNX>ReiNX</a> homebrew on it and got banned 
because he went online...  his father made his son sell the switch?  I ended up returning son's files to the seller's son.  funnily, the account was still 
on the switch and I googled his username and found him on gbatemp and PMed him and ended up giving him his images/vids back to him.   
I did wiped out his account and data and backed up the boot and NAND before I do running of my chossen CFW.   
It do not matter to me if my second switch was banned or not.  
I have many plans with my switches now.  one of them is write homebrew weather app and porting one of games.
other one is running android and load my favorite android apps. one issue is no gps on switch.      
I am having fun modding Super Mario Odyssey. I already made few mods or so.   
I found many good modded levels.  I loaded them on my switch and played them on my lunches lately.  
I tested one of my mods and it worked sweet.   
<p>
I uploaded vids of my game plays and mods on my youtube.<p>
