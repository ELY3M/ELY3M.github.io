<p><b>My Reasons for running atmosphere on my switches instead of xxxxxxx custom firmware</b><br>
<p>
1. It is free and open sourced. I love to read codes.  <br>
2. The atmosphere team is very nice people.<br>
3. They support homebrew apps, game mods, game cheats, and emunand.<br>
4. I can do changes to the code if I needed to.<br>
5. This cfw support very great themes.<br>
6. They are very fast with updating atmosphere code to work with the switch's firmware updates. (9.0.0 update was out on monday and They have it working in few days)<br>
7. lowest ban risk with your own legit games.  (I have not been banned on my online atmosphere switch with only game carts used on it.)<br> 
8. very flexible cfw and it is easy for me to work with.<br>
9. good support of using cheats.  I can easily use cheats in the games.   <br> 
10. sysmodule support. can use sysmodules like sys-ftpd and have ftpd server running in the background.
