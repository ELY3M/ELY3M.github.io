I have been loving fireworks since I was very little kid. I love to play with sparkers.
one day, my mother took me outside to show me the big display fireworks.
I believe at that time, that Jim Freeman was the one who made that show
on silver lake.  the fireworks was very huge at that time.
I noticed over the years, the firework show in Rochester is much hard to see from far away,
even the same place I was at when I saw display fireworks for first time.
I guess, they are using smaller shells now for safety reasons now.
My family like to shoot off some fireworks at cabin every summer.
This year (Summer 2009), I decided to join <a href=http://www.pgi.org target=NEWWIN>PGI</a> to learn more about fireworks.
I took display firework operator course and passed the course.  I got to light up few firework shells :)
I plan to do some of my own firework displays.  I just need to get permits to purchase those shells.
There are plenty of videos on my youtube account that I took of many events at PGI.  <p>
